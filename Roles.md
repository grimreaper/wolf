# Introduction #

This page is for detailing each role and how it is to be used.


# The Villagers #

The villagers are the basic role on the side of the townspeople, comprising the vast majority of the townspeople at the beginning. This role has no special powers, and at night has no function. At day, the villagers may contribute to the daily lynching.

# The Wolves #

The wolves are the antagonists of the town. At day, they may participate in the daily lynching, and at night, the wolves collaborate to choose a single victim to be eaten. If at any time the wolves outnumber all of the other classes, the wolves rush everyone and win.

# The Seer #

The seer is one of the "special roles" on the side of the townspeople. While acting like a normal villager at day, every night the seer may "see" any individual he desires, learning their class. The seer is a highly valuable asset to the town, and thus is a high-priority target for the wolves.

# The Harlot #

The harlot is another "special role" for the townspeople. Like the seer, they act like a normal villager at day, however, every night they can "sleep" with any individual of their choice. If they sleep with the seer or a villager, both parties will be notified. However, if they sleep with a wolf, the harlot will automatically be killed. However, if the harlot is targetted while sleeping with another person, the wolves will fail to kill the harlot, and will instead kill a pet penguin in their frustration.
